 * Hook that uses `IntersectionObserver` to trigger `onIntersect` callback when element is in viewport.
 * Callback is called only once.
 * Hook returns a function that you need to use to set a reference of the element you want to observe.
 * @example
 * const onIntersection = React.useCallback(() => {
 *   console.log('Element is in viewport!');
 * }, []);
 * const ref = useIntersection(onIntersection);
 * return (<div ref={ref}>One of many elements</div>);
